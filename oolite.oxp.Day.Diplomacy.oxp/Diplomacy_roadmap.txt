Diplomacy roadmap
=================

Conditions for 1.0 to be declared:
- filesave format stabilized,
- performance considered to be ok.

FIXME +.1: this is the annual tax, the return should be proportional to the time elapsed since the previous jump.
How do we know the real productivity? Is there an OMC? Black work wouldn't be reported, nor taxed.
All these information could be put into an Oolitopedia.
Should we set the productivity? Make it evolve :) ?
Productivity is directly linked to the money / inflation
=> where space is scarce, activity is automatically more expensive, and productivity is higher.
Should we rename Tax -> Economy?
FIXME +.1: use tco to avoid recursion: http://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/js-recursion.html

FIXME +.2 storing the history
FIXME +.3 manage versioning of savefiles
FIXME +.4: give access of _systemsByGalaxyAndSystemId to oxp developers. A SystemsAPI :)
FIXME +.5 identifying player as citizen from some system (Citizenship)
FIXME +.6 player taxation
FIXME 0.n passengers are taxed too; maybe player may pay less depending on passenger home system? why would passenger allow that?
FIXME 0.n some systems could have their citizens not taxed? free passage? by some chosen systems? vassal systems?
FIXME 0.n minify, https://jscompress.com/, https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2
FIXME 0.n Troll wars (noble Troll specie against human cultural trolls)
FIXME 0.n benchmark with lazy regexps

FIXME +.6: implement initial scoring of relations between systems
notion of goodwill towards systems in range
goodwill low depending on history:
if they have attacked that turn,
polarization? if the system has several neighbours, it dislikes better one of them
if they have attacked that turn a member of the alliance,
if they prepare for attack (even an enemy?),
if they're from an opposite ideology,
if they're from an opposite economy,
if they're from a different alliance (enemy alliance?)
if they currently got a bad economy?
if the other currently has a bad economy?
polarization? if the system has several neighbours, it dislikes better one of them
if they harbor an enemy faction
polarization: if they have enough money to attack and the other not enough to defend
goodwill high:
if they have helped in the past,
if they are member of the alliance,
if they prepare for defense,
if they're from a comparable economy
if they're from a comparable ideology
if they're next to a common enemy
if they're on a commercial road?
polarization? if the system has several neighbours, it likes better one of them
if they harbor an ally faction
polarization: if they have enough money to defend and the other not enough to attack
What's an enemy?
initial scoring + eventsScoring losing 10% each turn (year?) + current turn eventStoring
initialScore = economy comparison + ideology comparison + commercial road

FIXME 0.n: implement all of that :)
"ATTACK", //(System, System)
"LOSS", //(System, System)
"VICTORY", //(System, System)
"BANKRUPTCY", //(System)
"LEAVE", //(System, Alliance)
"JOIN", //(System, Alliance)
"SPLIT", //(Alliance, Alliance...)
"COMBINE", //(Alliance, Alliance)
"TAX", //(Alliance, System)
"SUBSIDIZE", //(Alliance, System)
"DEFENSE_PREPARATION", //(System)
"ATTACK_PREPARATION" //(System)

FIXME 0.n: make the tax level evolve
FIXME 0.n have an indicator "Ongoing war" per system
FIXME 0.n have a notion of "war zone"
FIXME 0.n have a notion of galaxy, station, traveller
FIXME 0.n tax evasion
FIXME 0.n factions?
FIXME 0.n news, depending on player current system, player citizenship system, propaganda? maybe the right way is to generate LOTS of news and let the player register to those they want? Snoopers, citizenship news company
FIXME 0.n blockades
FIXME 0.n each turn, a system has an event card: a sun explodes, or a native singer becomes famous, which changes taxes, or alliances, or fights, or... Use some mega bomb for a supernova style event
FIXME 0.n what about the story of a war writing itself?
FIXME 0.n war cargoes
FIXME 0.n the neatest definition of diplomacy I've seen is "The art of saying 'nice doggy' while you reach behind you for a rock to throw."
FIXME 0.n player's greed is the key

---------------------------------------------------------------

FIXME 0.f identifying player as citizen from some system (Citizenship), consequences
FIXME 0.f player taxation
FIXME 0.f the strategic map should be available through an equipment, or a role (commander ;) )

FIXME 0.n manage versioning of savefiles (once all functionalities are used)

FIXME 0.perfectperf use tco to avoid recursion: http://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/js-recursion.html
FIXME 0.perfectperf minify, https://jscompress.com/, https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2
FIXME 0.perfectperf benchmark with lazy regexps

FIXME 0.z make a story/scenario generator?

FIXME 0.z Productivity
How do we know the real productivity? Is there an OMC? Black work wouldn't be reported, nor taxed.
All these information could be put into an Oolitopedia.
Should we set the productivity? Make it evolve :) ?
Productivity is directly linked to the money / inflation
=> where space is scarce, activity is automatically more expensive, and productivity is higher.
Should we rename Tax -> Economy?

FIXME 0.z passengers are taxed too; maybe player may pay less depending on passenger home system? why would passenger allow that?
FIXME 0.z some systems could have their citizens not taxed? free passage? by some chosen systems? vassal systems?
FIXME 0.z "Troll wars" (noble Troll specie against human cultural trolls)
FIXME 0.z "Trumble wars" (trumbles are used as weapons to disrupt blockades)
FIXME 0.z "Day of the Tentacle"
FIXME 0.z the events history could be visualized through Snoopers
FIXME 0.z the events history could be visualized through a map

FIXME 0.z: implement scoring of relations between systems
goodwill low depending on history:
if they have attacked that turn,
polarization? if the system has several neighbours, it dislikes better one of them
if they have attacked that turn a member of the alliance,
if they prepare for attack (even an enemy?),
if they're from an opposite economy,
if they're from a different alliance (enemy alliance?)
if they currently got a bad economy?
if the other currently has a bad economy?
if they're from a disliked race
polarization? if the system has several neighbours, it dislikes better one of them
if they harbor an enemy faction
polarization: if they have enough money to attack and the other not enough to defend
goodwill high:
if they have helped in the past,
if they are member of the alliance,
if they prepare for defense,
if they're from a comparable economy
if they're next to a common enemy
if they're on a commercial road?
if they're from a liked race
polarization? if the system has several neighbours, it likes better one of them
if they harbor an ally faction
polarization: if they have enough money to defend and the other not enough to attack
What's an enemy?
initial scoring + eventsScoring losing 10% each turn (year?) + current turn eventStoring
initialScore = economy comparison + ideology comparison + commercial road
who should we score? a system scores those systems it is observing?
staticScore[observerId][observedId] = {
    economyComparison:,
    ideologyComparison:,
    sameCommercialRoad:,
}
dynamicScore[observerId][observedId] = {
    nextToCommonEnemy:,
    preparingForDefense:,
    harboursEnemyFaction:,
}
ally to alliance if avg(systemsScores) > threshold
attack if systemMoney > targetProductivity * targetPopulation, divided by constant

FIXME 0.z: make the tax level evolve
FIXME 0.z have an indicator "Ongoing war" per system
FIXME 0.z have a notion of "war zone"
FIXME 0.z have a notion of galaxy, station, traveller as actors
FIXME 0.z tax evasion
FIXME 0.z factions?
FIXME 0.z news, depending on player current system, player citizenship system, propaganda?
 maybe the right way is to generate LOTS of news and let the player register to those they want?
 Snoopers, citizenship news company
FIXME 0.z blockades
FIXME 0.z each turn, a system has an event card: a sun explodes, or a native singer becomes famous, which changes taxes, or alliances, or fights, or... Use some mega bomb for a supernova style event
FIXME 0.z what about the story of a war writing itself?
FIXME 0.z war cargoes
FIXME 0.z player's greed is the key
FIXME 0.z: "OXP that adds another eight galaxies" !!

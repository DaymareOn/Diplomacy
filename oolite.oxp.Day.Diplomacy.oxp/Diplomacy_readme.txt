Description

Hello everybody,

this OXP intended goal is to allow historical events to happen between systems (attacks, loots,
 alliances, taxes...), and to have actions depending on this (news, massed flotillas, state racket, who knows?).
Technically, I see it as a war/diplomacy framework. It includes a good JsDoc for oxp developers.

It is STILL a Work In Progress.

In particular, the savefile format might change in the future; so it wouldn't do to expect a savefile from an old
 version to work with a newer version code.
If experimenting problems, the easy way is to edit the savefile and remove the lines including "Diplomacy".
 Then next start, the oxp will begin anew.

==============================
What's currently implemented functionality-wise?

Systems treasury!
    Wars require money, and countries are defeated either by battles or by bankruptcy,
     sometimes the latter producing the former.
    The Treasury and Tax levels are displayed in the F7 system information.
    Each system treasury is increased through taxation each player jump,
     depending on the time past since the last jump.

Strategic maps!
    Showing the warring systems, and the diplomatic relationships!
    Requires the advanced navigational array equipment.

Systems alliances, wars!
    Two systems within 7ly of each other may now form an alliance, if they like each other enough.
    They may break their alliance, too =-o !
    They may wage war to each other, and make peace too :) !
    New F4 Interface screen: the Systems History!

News!
    Some GNN news are now displayed when an alliance is formed or broken between two systems,
      or when a war starts or ends between two systems, and the player is in one of those systems.

Citizenships!
    The player may acquire, or renounce, a system citizenship when visiting this system, for the right price. They may
      choose which one of their citizenships is announced as the flag of their ship.
    The player is considered fugitive when in systems warring with their flag.
    Anarchies provide no citizenship and have no embassy district.
    The player may buy days of visa in the Embassy district in a neighbouring, non-enemy from the destination, system.
    Corporate systems, dictatorships and communists refuse docking to the player when stateless and visaless.

==============================
What's currently implemented technically?

The oxp contains Engines which may be use by developers to implement interesting galaxy-spanning events:
- (main) Engine,
- War,
- History,
- Systems,
- Economy,
- Citizenships.

==============================
Effects on game difficulty

+ the player is considered fugitive when in systems warring with their flag.
+ the player is refused docking in some stations when they have not the requisite visa or passport.
+ some new ways to spend money: passports, visas.

==============================
Effects on game performance

This oxp works only when the player is docked, so there is no impact during the flight time.
During the docking, it works once every ten frames, the effect on player experience should be negligible.
If it isn't negligible, tell me and I'll put in the ability to choose the number of frames.
Even if the effect is negligible on the player, it uses lots of cpu, so it might not be negligible on the battery.

0.16    Improvement, flavor: the player is considered fugitive when in systems warring with their flag.
        Improvement, flavor: no "Embassy district" in anarchies, no citizenship in an Anarchy
        Improvement, flavor: the player may buy days of visa (cost: productivity / population / 365 per day) in the embassy district in a neighbouring, non-enemy from the destination system.
        Improvement, flavor: the first time the Diplomacy OXP is used, if a visa is needed in the current system, we give the player a 1-day visa.

        Improvement, performance: the API are removed in favor of JsDoc.
        Improvement, code quality: the Snoopers dependency, which is deprecated, is replaced by the GNN dependency. Oolite minimal required version is now 1.88, because of this.
        Improvement, code quality: moved the GNN connection to external script.
        Improvement, code quality: tax level and treasury are now displayed through mission.addMessageText rather than through a modification of the system description.
        Improvement, tweaking: the alliance threshold between systems is lowered.

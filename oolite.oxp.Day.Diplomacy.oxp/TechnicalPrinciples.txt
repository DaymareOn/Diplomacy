Architecture / dev principles
-----------------------------

Minimize cost of closures.
Minimize cost of dereference.
Most performance-sensible part is (de)serialization.

The least possible closures (impossible to remove eval())
Use prototypes when possible to minimize cpu and memory usage.
No need to use prototypes for singletons.
No need to use singletons as the script is one (cost of dereference).
Use compiled regexps.
Objects only to benefit from 'this' in functions.
Id for every non unique data structure.
